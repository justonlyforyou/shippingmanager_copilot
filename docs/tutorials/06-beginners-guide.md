## 1. Golden Rules for Beginners

1.  **Avoid Tanker Operations** until you reach Level 50.
2.  **Prioritize Staff Happiness:** Keep your staff status at "Very Happy" (100%) at all times.
3.  **Maintain Reputation:** Ensure your reputation stays at the top level (>90%).
4.  **Vessel Maintenance:** Keep your ships in pristine condition (wear < 2%).
5.  **No IPOs:** Stay away from Initial Public Offerings unless you are using a bot or have an excessive amount of free time.
6.  **Focus on Growth:** Concentrate on your own expansion until you are earning at least **$200m per day**.
7.  **Alliance Strategy:** Join an alliance to reap the benefits, **BUT** ensure you enable COOP in return.
8.  **Smart Purchasing:** Only buy anchor points in bundles of 10 to maximize savings.

## 2. Fleet Strategy & Vessel Recommendations

### Phase 1: The Starter Fleet
Fill your initial slots with the following standard vessels:
* **30 slots:** Navicon
* **30 slots:** Astronz
* **30 slots:** Aquavita

### Phase 2: Customization & Upgrades
Once your initial fleet is established, begin the transition to high-efficiency custom ships:
1.  Replace all **Astronz** and **Navicon** ships with **custom 2,000 TEU MIH X1 (11,000kW)** vessels.
2.  Finally, replace all 30 **Aquavitas** with **27,000 TEU MIH X1 (11,000kW)** vessels.

> **Result:** This fleet configuration creates a powerhouse capable of generating **$100–120 million per day** (or more) with exceptionally low fuel and CO₂ costs.

## 3. Route Optimization

For low-level accounts using the fleet described above, the "sweet spot" for balancing income versus operating costs lies in routes between **1,500 nm and 3,500 nm**.

## 4. Staff Training Priorities

Follow this order to maximize efficiency early on:

1.  **Shop Cash:** Up to Level 15
2.  **Cheap Fuel:** Up to Level 10
3.  **Technical Officer (Less Fuel Consumption):** Up to Level 5
4.  ~~Cheap CO₂:** Up to Level 10~~ Not possible because of a bug
    * Instead do **Boatswains (slower wear on vessels):** Up to 5
5.  **Cheap Anchor Points:** Up to Level 20
6.  **Cheap Fuel:** Up to Level 20
7.  ~~**Cheap CO₂:** Up to Level 20~~ Not possible because of a bug
    * Instead do **CTO (slower wear on vessels):** Up to 20
8.  **Cheap Harbor Fees:** Up to Level 20
9. **Captain (Lower Crew Unhappiness):** Up to Level 5
10. **Boatswain (Slower Wear):** Up to Level 5
11. **First Officer (Less Crew Needed):** Up to Level 5

## 5. The "Contribution Race" Strategy

There is only one real secret to mastering the Contribution Race: **Strategic Fleet Division.**

As you progress, money becomes increasingly less valuable compared to contribution points. You must organize your fleet into two distinct operational groups:
* **Group A:** Focuses purely on generating income.
* **Group B:** Focuses exclusively on generating the maximum amount of contribution points possible.
