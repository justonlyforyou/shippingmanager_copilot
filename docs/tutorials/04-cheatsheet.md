# 🚢 Cheat Sheet / Glitch Guide

## ⚡ Faster Delivery Glitch

1. **Build** a new vessel. (Does not work with vessels you bought)
2. Go straight to **Maintenance > Dry Dock** and select your fresh ship.
3. Send it to the dry dock immediately.
4. Just ignore any weird behavior or visual bugs around the ship for a moment you mabe have ingame.
5. Check the **Pending Tab** (left side menu) and wait for the maintenance timer to hit zero.
6. **Done:** Once maintenance finishes, your ship "arrives" instantly (skipping the delivery travel time).
7. **Bonus:** You just doubled the time until the next required dry dock!
8. *Check the next bug below, you can combo these two.* 👇

## 🛠️ "Unlimited" time until next DryDock

1. Every new vessel spawns at a port that has a dry dock.
2. **CRITICAL:** Before you send your ship anywhere, throw it into the dry dock.
3. This glitches the timer: The "Time to next Dry Dock" gets added on top of the default value.
   * *Example:* Default is 350h > after first dry dock it’s 700h > then 1050h, etc.
4. **Rinse and repeat:** You can do this as many times as you want. We haven't found a limit yet - as long as you have the in-game cash to pay for it! 💸
